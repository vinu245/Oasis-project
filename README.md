# OASIS Infobyte Data Science Internship Projects

# Overview

This repository contains three data science projects completed as part of the OASIS Infobyte Internship. Each project applies data science techniques, including data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning modeling.

# Projects

# 1. Iris Flower Detection

Objective: Classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their features.

Dataset: The Iris dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

# Approach:

Load and explore the dataset

Perform data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn

Apply classification models such as Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Evaluate models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

# Tools & Libraries:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

# 2. Unemployment Analysis

Objective: Analyze unemployment trends and visualize the unemployment rate using data analysis techniques.

Dataset: Unemployment dataset (source: Government/online repositories).

# Approach:

Load and clean the dataset

Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns

Visualize unemployment trends using bar plots, line graphs, and heatmaps

Provide insights into unemployment trends over time and across demographics

# Tools & Libraries:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

# 3. Car Price Prediction

Objective: Predict car prices based on features like brand, model, mileage, fuel type, and other specifications.

Dataset: Car price dataset (source: Kaggle/online repositories).

# Approach:

Load and preprocess the dataset (handle missing values, encode categorical data)

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to find correlations

Train regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost

Evaluate models using RMSE, R-squared, and MAE

# Tools & Libraries:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
